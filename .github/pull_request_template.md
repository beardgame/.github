<!-- This template is a guideline; use your own judgement to write a description that is easy to read and will help get the PR reviewed quickly and accurately -->

<!-- Please add a short, clear title that states what this PR changes -->
<!-- Tag your PR with all of the following tags that are relevant:
  * `fix` if your PR includes a fix for unintentional behavior;
  * `feature` if your PR includes new functionality;
  * `breaking-change` if your PR includes a change that may break existing clients;
  * `ignore-release` if your PR should not be included in release notes (for example if it's exclusively related to maintenance and/or CI).
If one of these tags is not available, contact somebody from the beardgame/owners team.
